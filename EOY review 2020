Kimberly’s 2020 major accomplishments include
•	Delivering Market risk progress tool for SRE, MRMO and tech management to monitor the progress of market risk processes like VaR, Stress, and Volcker, DE etc.
•	Delivering Market Risk’s strategic monitoring and control tool over web called Falcon Command Center.
•	Delivering bulk action features on command center for SRE and MRMO to perform control function for bulk of supplies.
•	Delivering a clear feed orchestration monitoring for prod and for any development environments in a way that all information related to a run can be obtained from that one page.
•	Various small enhancements like py2-py3, bug fixes, enhancements etc.
Kim, in a single day put up the Market risk progress monitoring tool which was well received and appreciated by everyone in Management, SRE and MRMO. This is the first time in MR history, that as a team, we were able to show the progress of various processes in a single dashboard. Kim, being first UI developer using React JS/Typescript stack for core team, have really learnt to be a seasoned/experienced UI developer. In the process, she also made sure, some of the work can be made extensible for new dashboard to be added without much ground work.  This let to huge growth of the UI features which now hosts monitoring for different workflows like Data Sourcing, FRTB etc. Most of the MRMO asks for the command center has been built and delivered to the stake holder satisfaction. 
Overall, she had a productive year and I wish her very best and would like to continue working wither for more project deliveries.
** Comment from Stakeholder: MRMO **
Kim is excellent to work with. She's very responsive and helpful when it comes to fielding questions on the Falcon Command Center. She helps us understand and prioritize new requirements for the CC with each iterative release. Sh also works with me after hours to help ensure we've done the proper testing before rolling into production. Because of her work we've been able to use a tool that is now benefiting the entire team with quick copyforwards, better feed/supply monitoring and audit log tracking. We hope to continue working with her for more improvements and getting us away from legacy tools due to this current work.
Client / Customer / Stakeholder (S)
One of main accomplishments for Kim this year has been able to get both SRE and MRMO on weekly prioritization forum and agree on controls and monitoring needed for MR processes. The control features were delivered to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
** Comment from Stakeholder: MRMO ** I had the pleasure of working with Kim this year on the build of the Falcon BPM tool.  She listened to requirements and reasoning for prioritization, and when prioritized, she delivered and delivered in a very timely fashion.  She has an easy-going manner about her and is a pleasure to partner with.  She obviously has the technical expertise to deliver as she has done all year.  I can see tremendous progress toward a one-stop tool that MRMO and SRE can use to manage feed processing and remediation.  She is a top-performer in my book.

What do they need to start doing, stop doing or improve?

Probably needs to focus a bit more testing before pushing to prod, especially since the UI and its related components are unlikely to be caught by source marker tests
